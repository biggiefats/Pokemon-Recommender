teams that you have shown to the program.

- Via the file created in the same directory, named 'pokemon_team.txt', enter the names of six Pokwmon **on separate lines**

- Ensure that you manipulate the program code to output and call different methods from the class based on what you need in a Pokemon (e.g. attack, speed)
