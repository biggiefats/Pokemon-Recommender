# Pokemon Recommendation Program

## Overview
A program that looks over the first 7 generations of Pokemon by recommending Pokemon to go against
teams that you have shown to the program.

## How To Use
- Run the program
- Via the file created in the same directory, named 'pokemon_team.txt', enter the names of six Pokwmon **on separate lines**
- Press *Enter* in the terminal
- The program should output a Pandas dataframe containing Pokemon you want to use
- Ensure that you manipulate the program code to output and call different methods from the class based on what you need in a Pokemon (e.g. attack, speed)
